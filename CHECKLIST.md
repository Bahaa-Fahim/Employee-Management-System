## Troubleshooting

### If you see 404 errors:

2. Verify `index.html` has the routing script
3. Make sure base path in `vite.config.js` is correct

### If assets don't load:
1. Check `package.json` homepage URL
2. Verify `vite.config.js` base path
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### If build fails:
1. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies
2. Check for any import errors
3. Verify all file paths are correct

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Important Notes

- **Repository Name**: Must match the base path in `vite.config.js`
- **GitHub Username**: Must be correct in `package.json` homepage
- **Branch**: Deployment uses `gh-pages` branch, not `main`
- **HTTPS**: GitHub Pages provides HTTPS automatically
- **Caching**: Changes may take a few minutes to appear
